<p>We are looking for volunteers to <em>take over</em> this project. While it is nice to have people help out a bit every now and then, we have moved on and need some one to actually take full charge of the project. Until this happens there won't be much further progress made with UWSUBE. If you are interested, please visit the 'Contact Us' page and send us an email. A little ambition can go a long way and we are here to give you the support you need to get things started.</p>

<h1>GitHub</h1>
<p>As of October 2012 we have made the source code of this site feely available on <a href="https://github.com/andrejpavlovic/sube" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You can now contribute your own ideas or build a site just like this one!</p>

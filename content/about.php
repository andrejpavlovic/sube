<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>UWSUBE was created by UW alumni in the hopes to create a simple, easy to use, and effective online exchange for students to buy/sell textbooks. The site went live in November of 2004.</p>
<p>The site supports a quick list feature that allows students (and anybody else!) to quickly add a listing without a lengthy registration process. The seller simply types in a password than can be used to later edit and remove the listing.</p>
<p>UWSUBE is for looking volunteers to help with the promotion and continued maintanence of the exchange. Please see the join us section for more information.</p>
